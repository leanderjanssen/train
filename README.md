# Train

Train is a set of Amazon Web Services CLI tools (packaged in a Docker container) used to manage AWS users, VPC's, user keys/security, AMI's, custom labs (one or more AWS instances grouped by tag), and sets of labs to be used for demos, testing, and training.

- **train**: Primary tool - Manages all VPC Objects and instances
- **train-users**: Manages additional users allowed to use **train**
- **train-images**: Manages associated lab AMI's

---

The tools provide a simple way to quickly create, manage, and destroy:

### VPC Objects

- VPC
- IAM profile, role, policy
- Gateway
- Route table
- Network ACL
- Subnets
- Default security group and rules
- Key pairs for multiple users
- Labs (Grouping of one or more instances with specific configurations)
- Termination and clean-up of all created objects/files

### AWS IAM Users

- Manage (Create, list, and delete) AWS IAM Users

### AMIs

- Manage (Create, list, and delete) AMI's associated with custom labs.

### Registration for training/testing

- Bulk registration (Launch labs for users listed in a text file)
- Registration mode: A 'Kiosk' style registration mode that provides a welcome message and prompts for email address used to launch labs.

## Requirements

### AWS Permissions

It's recommended you create a separate AWS account separate from your prod, dev, staging accounts. **Train** requires extensive IAM roles/permissions. (Create, list, and destroy: VPC's, EC2 instances/objects, IAM users, etc...)

Any user created with the `train-users` tool has the following policy: https://github.com/kizbitz/train/blob/master/train/vpc/users.py#L12-L41

### Environment Variables

Environment variables can be set in the container by:

- Creating/using a Docker environment file (Used in the following examples)
- Pass them in when running the container
- Export them directly in the container

#### Required Environment Variables

```
TRAINER=jbaker
AWS_REGION=<region>
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<id>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<key>
```

Available AWS Regions

| Region Name | Region |
| --- | --- |
| US East (N. Virginia)	| us-east-1 |
| US West (Oregon)	| us-west-2 |
| US West (N. California)	| us-west-1 |
| EU (Ireland)	| eu-west-1 |
| EU (Frankfurt)	| eu-central-1 |
| Asia Pacific (Singapore)	| ap-southeast-1 |
| Asia Pacific (Tokyo)	| ap-northeast-1 |
| Asia Pacific (Sydney)	| ap-southeast-2 |
| Asia Pacific (Seoul)	| ap-northeast-2 |
| South America (Sao Paulo)	| sa-east-1 |

---

When using the bulk registration feature or registration mode a [Mailgun API Key](https://mailgun.com/) is also required

```
MAILGUN_KEY=<mailgun-key>
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=<mailgun-domain>
```

Note: TRAINER (username) is only used for tagging VCP objects only. It is not tied to any permissions.

#### Optional Environment Variables

```
# Root lab directory
LAB_DIR=<lab-directory>

# Full path to user configuration file
USER_FILE=<config-file>

# Tag for VPC, labs, instances, etc... (Recommended for different environments)
VPC=<vpc-tag>

# Template file for registration emails
EMAIL_TEMPLATE=<path-to-template-file-in-container>
```

### Host Volume

A local host volume needs to be mounted inside the container to `/host` when running the container. The scripts will output all user keys and user instance information into a `/host/<VPC>` directory.

## Walk-through - Personal Use

The following section is a walk-through of usage for personal use (Useful for demos and individuals involved in QA/documentation/support teams)

Pull the Docker image:

```
vagrant@dockertest:~$ docker pull leanderjanssen/train
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from kizbitz/train
843e2bded498: Pull complete
  *content removed*
81395f1294cc: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:146ff25a5b7fa8a4dd9914359c93f0be2c35ff0ca4a19045a1585dc07e005e0b
Status: Downloaded newer image for kizbitz/train:latest
```

Create a temp working directory:

```
vagrant@dockertest:~$ mkdir sandbox
vagrant@dockertest:~$ cd sandbox/
```

Create a Docker environment file with required environment variables:

```
vagrant@dockertest:~/sandbox$ vim train.env
vagrant@dockertest:~/sandbox$ cat train.env
TRAINER=jbaker
VPC=demo
AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-aws-access-key>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-aws-secret-access-key>
```

Run the container with the environment file and mount a host volume:

```
vagrant@dockertest:~/sandbox$ ls -al
total 12
drwxrwxr-x  2 vagrant vagrant 4096 Jan 12 10:46 .
drwxr-xr-x 10 vagrant vagrant 4096 Jan 12 10:46 ..
-rw-------  1 vagrant vagrant  219 Jan 12 10:46 train.env
vagrant@dockertest:~/sandbox$ docker run -ti --rm --env-file='train.env' -v $(pwd):/host leanderjanssen/train
jbaker-demo:eu-west-1:~$
```

After entering the container note that the prompt is displaying the: **TRAINER-VPC:AWS_REGION** environment variables.

```
jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$
```

Executing `train` without any arguments will display help:

```
jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$ train
usage: train [-h] [-v] [-k] [-a] [-i <lab>] [-x <lab>] [-r <lab>] [-e] [-l]
             [-d <tag>] [-p] [-t]

Train: AWS CLI Tool

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -v          Create AWS VPC
  -k          Create AWS key pairs
  -a          List all available labs
  -i <lab>    View description for an available lab
  -x <lab>    Execute a lab
  -r <lab>    Execute a lab in registration mode
  -e          Email instance information and credentials to users
  -l          List running labs and instances in AWS
  -d <tag>    Delete a lab from AWS
  -p          Purge/Delete all instances in VPC
  -t          Terminate environment (VPC and local files)
jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$
```

Create the new VPC (along with the required VCP objects) and generate your key pair (from the TRAINER environment variable) using the `-v` and `-k` flags:

```
jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$ train -vk

## Walk-through - Registration Modes

In addition to all of the above functionality, **train** provides two **registration modes** that can be used for providing instances to particpants in training events or hands-on lab scenarios.

- Bulk registration
- Registration (Kiosk) mode

### Bulk Registration

To use the bulk registration mode you create a user config file. By default, **train** will use a user config file:

- `/host/<VPC>/users.cfg`

Or, you can optionally set a custom file path with the USER_FILE environment variable: https://github.com/kizbitz/train/blob/master/train/vpc/config.py#L52

Create a **users.cfg** file in your the root of your VPC directory with a list of usernames and emails that will be used when creating key pairs and launching any lab instances.

- One user per line in the format: `<username>,<email>`

```
vagrant@docker:~/sandbox$ tree

```

**Note**: This example only has two users specified but there is no limit except for your AWS limits.

Run the container with the environment file and mount a host volume:

```
vagrant@docker:~/sandbox$ ls -al

jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$
```

Email all users their lab instance information and keys:

Note:

- Requires a MAILGUN_KEY and MAILGUN_DOMAIN - See requirements section above.
- Recommended that you use a customized email template. See: https://github.com/kizbitz/train/blob/master/train/vpc/config.py#L58
  - By default **train** will look for an email template in: `/host/<VPC>/email.py`
  - If `/host/<VPC>/email` does not exist the template that will be used is located here: https://github.com/kizbitz/train/blob/master/train/templates/email.py
  - You can also specify the email template to use with an `EMAIL_TEMPLATE` environment variable. See: https://github.com/kizbitz/train/blob/master/train/vpc/config.py#L58

```
jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$ train -e
Emailing user information and credentials ...
Enter the 'from email address' for the outgoing message: no-reply@docker.com
Enter the 'from name' for the outgoing message: Docker Training
Enter the 'Subject' for the outgoing message: Docker Training Demo
Welcome email sent to: 'jbaker' <jbaker@docker.com> ...
Welcome email sent to: 'mrcotton' <mrcotton@simpledove.com> ...
```

After training is complete terminate/purge all instances and VPC.

### Registration Mode

The alternative method of registration is using the `-r` flag to launch a lab.

This mode:

- Prompts for a welcome message
- Displays the welcome message and prompts for an email
- Creates a username from the email and creates the key pairs
- Launches the lab and then emails the user the connection info and keys

MAILGUN_KEY and MAILGUN_DOMAIN required and using a custom email template is recommend.

Notes:

- It's recommend to use a custom email template (with no prompts) that sets:
  - `from_email`, `from_name`, and `subject` variables with static entries.
    - See '/home/train/train/templates/email.py' in the container
- Specify 'EMAIL_TEMPLATE' environment variable with the path to your template
- The welcome message entered below will be shown to each individial before prompting for email.
- To exit registration mode type 'exit' during the email prompt.

Example usage:

```
jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$ train -r dtr-volume

Registration Mode:

- It's recommend to use a custom email template (with no prompts) that sets:
    - from_email, from_name, and subject variables with static entries.
        - See '/home/train/train/templates/email.py'
    - Specify 'EMAIL_TEMPLATE' environment variable with the path to your template

- The welcome message entered below will be shown to each individial before prompting for email.
- To exit registration mode type 'exit' during the email prompt.

Enter a welcome message: Welcome to Docker Training!
```

After the welcome message is entered the registration loop starts:

```

```

After enter is pressed the welcome message is displayed again and prompts for another email:

```
Welcome to Docker Training!

Please enter a valid email address:
```

When using the `-r` flag for registration usernames and emails are collected in the file `/host/registered-users.txt` for use with post-training surveys, etc...:

```
jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$ cat /host/registered-users.txt
jbaker,jbaker@docker.com
mrcotton,mrcotton@simpledove.com
```

## train-images

The train-images CLI tool is used to manage AMI's for labs. Depending on how long it takes the cloud-init script to finish it can be quicker to create an AMI of the final instance to launch instead of the specified cloud-init script. (Especially during training events and hands-on labs)

Notes:

- Only one AMI is created per instance definition in instances.cfg. This will be the `<name>-0` instance when **NAME** is used in the definition or the zero index of the **NAMES** list. See: https://github.com/kizbitz/train/blob/master/train/labs/template/instances.cfg#L16-L22
- When launching a lab **train** checks for existing AMI images for the lab and will use those if present. If not, the standard cloud-init script is used.

### Example usage

Executing `train-images` without any arguments will display help:

```
jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$ train-images
usage: train-images [-h] [-c <lab>] [-d <lab>] [-l] [-r]

Train: AWS CLI AMI Management

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -c <lab>    Create lab AMI's
  -d <lab>    Deregister lab AMI's
  -l          List all AMI's
  -r          List running labs
jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$
```

List running labs:

```
jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$ train-images -r

Running labs:
  dtr-volume-1

jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$
```

Create AMI's for a lab:

```
jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$ train-images -c dtr-volume-1
Creating AMI's for lab: dtr-volume-1
Completed ...
```

Note: Depending on the current state of the AWS workers it could take a while before the final image is available.

List all AMI's

```
jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$ train-images -l

AWS AMI's:

  ID: ami-94bfe4fe
  Name: jbaker-demo-dtr-volume-ubuntu-0
  Description: dtr-volume lab AMI
  Region: us-east-1
  Tags:
     Name: jbaker-demo-dtr-volume-ubuntu-0
     AMI-Key: 0
     Lab: dtr-volume

jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$
```

Deregistering an AMI:

```
jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$ train-images -d dtr-volume
Degristering jbaker-demo-dtr-volume-ubuntu-0 ...
Completed ...
jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$
```

## train-users

**train-users** is a CLI tool for current AWS administrators to manage new **train** users.

Executing `train-users` without any arguments will display help:

```
jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$ train-users
usage: train-users [-h] [-c <user>] [-d <user>] [-l]

Train: AWS CLI IAM/User Management

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -c <user>   Create IAM/User
  -d <user>   Delete AWS user
  -l          List all users
```

Using the `-c` flag will create a new user account and return the credentials that you can pass on.

```
baker-demo:us-east-1:~$ train-users -c mrcotton
Allow user to log into the AWS Console? [y/n]: y

'mrcotton' user created succesfully ...

Username: mrcotton
Password: 7F9@Yy2x33ye(Wwh4
Access Key ID: ABCDJEKAAUUBSXYZ2W7YB7A
Secret Access Key: KsappDockerfCUlc-SyuWdx9xBxROUof9nnSj3uz

jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$
```

List all users:

```
jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$ train-users -l

Current AWS user accounts:

- jbaker
- mrcotton

jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$
```

Delete a user:

```
jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$ train-users -d mrcotton
Are you sure you want to delete user: 'mrcotton'? [y/n]: y
'mrcotton' AWS user deleted ...
jbaker-demo:us-east-1:~$
```

**WARNING:** Security for your environment is **your** responsibility. Users created with this tool have a lot of permissions. Remember to audit your users and rotate keys/passwords to keep your environment secure.

### Custom Labs

- A template lab is provided that you can use as a starting base.
- All current labs for reference: https://github.com/kizbitz/train/tree/master/train/labs

### Tips

If you switch VPCs often you can create a helper function and pass in your VPC for launching your container.

Example function for Bash (~/.bashrc on your Docker host):

```
function train {
  if [ -z ${1} ]; then
    docker run -ti --rm --env-file='train.env' -v $(pwd):/host kizbitz/train
  else
    docker run -ti --rm --env-file='train.env' -e VPC=${1} -v $(pwd):/host kizbitz/train
  fi
}
```
